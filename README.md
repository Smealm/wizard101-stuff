stuff i use for wizard101

fastboot.bat: place this inside your wizard101 game folder, the root of it. run it to bypass the integrity checker for wizard101, doing so can make booting the game significantly faster on older devices.

for steam users place fastboot.bat inside your game root directory then right click wizard101 in steam and go to properties -> general -> launch options and type `fastboot.bat %command%` into it and hit save, now when you launch the game within steam it will automatically skip the integrity check.
